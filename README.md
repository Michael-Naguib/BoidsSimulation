# BoidsSimulation
- Boids are a way of modeling the complex flocking behavior of birds as well as many marine life including schools of fish; 
- The simple rules which are able to generate complex behaviors have been described by Craig Reynolds https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/
- These rules include Cohesion (tendancy to stick together), Separation (tendency to separate),  and Alignment (tendency to follow in same direction)   ... please refer to the sight for more details
- Pictures and or videos from the simulation will be included in this readme at a later date (... they need to be coded first)
